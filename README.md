# Hi there, I'm Ajith Senthil 👋

🎓 **Educational Journey:** I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm diving deep into Psychological Science with a minor in Statistics. I hold a BS in Computer Science + Linguistics and Brain and Cognitive Science from the same university.

🔍 **Research & Innovation:** As a co-founder and active researcher at ByCog Research Group, I focus on Computational Psychodynamics, modeling personality and cognition through active inference. At the Active Inference Institute, I'm developing frameworks to interpret human behavior and cognition, and I'm also part of the Learning Language Lab, exploring linguistic and visual cognition.

👨‍💻 **Professional Experience:** I lead the AI/ML Team at OpenPolitica and serve as Project Manager & Machine Learning Developer at NeuroTech@UIUC. My work includes developing innovative frameworks and applying AI to neuroscientific data.

📚 **Academic Pursuits:** My passion lies in unraveling the complexities of the human mind using computational models. I'm currently seeking a Ph.D. position to further my research at the intersection of AI and human cognition, blending insights from neuroscience to refine AI methodologies.

### What I'm Currently Up To
- 🧠 Pioneering Computational Psychodynamics at ByCog Research Group.
- 🤖 Developing innovative AI frameworks at the Active Inference Institute.
- 💬 Innovating with Attachment Bot in the Attachment and Close Relationships Lab.
- 🌐 Fostering democratic participation and civic discourse at OpenPolitica.
- 🧬 Applying AI to neuroscientific data at NeuroTech@UIUC.

### Technical Toolkit
- **Languages:** Proficient in Python, C++, Java, C#, R, C, PHP, SQL, Javascript, Haskell.
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Experienced with TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumSharp, NLTK, SpaCy, OpenAI API, LangChain, ChainLit, PineCone DB, HuggingFace Transformers.
- **Tools:** Skilled in Git, GitHub, Docker, Jupyter Notebook/Lab, Mathematica, Unity3D.
