# Hi there, I'm Ajith Senthil üëã

I'm a Master's student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, diving deep into the realms of Cognition and Deep Learning. As a co-founder and active researcher at the ByCog Research Group and a participant in cutting-edge projects at the Active Inference Institute, my work revolves around the synthesis of human cognition with artificial intelligence.

I'm driven by a passion to unravel the complexities of the human mind using computational models and am currently seeking a Ph.D. position where I can further my research at the intersection of AI and human cognition. My interdisciplinary background fuels my mission to leverage insights from neuroscience to refine AI methodologies.
