# Hi there, I'm Ajith Senthil 👋

🎓 **Educational Journey:** I'm an incoming PhD student at the University of Southern California for the SAND Lab studying behavior and computational models of personality using deep learning. I finished a Master's at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I dove in deep into Psychological Science with a Graduate minor in Statistics. I hold a BS in Computer Science + Linguistics and a BS in Brain and Cognitive Science from the same university.

🔍 **Research & Innovation:** As a co-founder and active researcher at ByCog Research Group, I focus on Computational Psychodynamics, modeling personality and cognition through active inference. At the Active Inference Institute, I'm developing frameworks to interpret human behavior and cognition, and I'm also part of the Learning Language Lab, exploring linguistic and visual cognition.

👨‍💻 **Professional Experience:** I am the CEO and lead the AI/ML Team at OpenPolitica and serve as Project Manager & Machine Learning Developer of a multi-university project called UniversumX affiliated with NeuroTechX and their student chapters at UIUC, UCLA, and USC. UniversumX is developing deep learning models of perception with Brain-Computer Interfaces for AI alignment. My work includes developing innovative frameworks and applying AI to neuroscientific data.

📚 **Academic Pursuits:** My passion lies in unraveling the complexities of the human mind using computational models. I'm currently seeking a research position to further my research at the intersection of AI and human cognition, blending insights from neuroscience to refine AI methodologies.
